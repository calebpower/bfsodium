; bfsodium XORWORD : the exclusive or of two four byte words
;
; NOTE square brackets are brainfuck loops  so comments use braces for counts;
;
; HAND WRITTEN; idiom/xor8 is PASTED four times;
;
; INTERFACE entry=24 exit=0 footprint=0:24
; IO  in:  a{4}  b{4}      (8 bytes)
;     out: (a xor b){4}    (4 bytes)
;
; AES IS FULL OF THIS; a word is the unit the key expansion works in  and
; AddRoundKey is four of these; It exists so that a caller pastes FOUR of them
; where it would otherwise paste sixteen exclusive ors;
;
; THE ANSWER COMES BACK OVER a  so a caller that pastes this gets its word
; replaced in place and needs no second buffer; That is what lets the key
; schedule and the regression in aes/decrypt128 work a slot over without a
; buffer of their own;
;
; ONE BYTE AT A TIME THROUGH THE SAME PASTE; idiom/xor8 sits at this file's
; own zero and takes its two operands at @0x01 and @0x02  handing the answer
; back at @0x00; So each byte is three steps: carry the two bytes down to the
; operand cells  paste  and carry the answer back over a's byte; The four
; blocks below are the same three steps with the offsets walked along;
;
; TAPE MAP  (home @0)
;   @0x00:0x10  idiom/xor8 pasted at this file's own zero; its two operands go
;               in at @0x01 and @0x02 and its answer comes back at @0x00
;   @0x11:0x14  a{4}  first word; THE ANSWER COMES BACK HERE
;   @0x15:0x18  b{4}  second word  spent
